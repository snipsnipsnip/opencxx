TIPS for installing OpenC++
===========================

- If you have a trouble to run the OpenC++ compiler, first make sure of
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  It has to include the current directory.

- Some g++ installations uses GNU ld, but this configuration may break
  dlopen().  ld supplied by the operating system should be used.

- If the operating system is Solaris 2.x, you may need -DSOLARIS_THREADS 
  to build the garbage collector.  If this option is specified, you also
  need to edit src/Unix/Makefile.Solaris so that CXXFLAGS includes
  that option and LIB includes -lthread.

- If your operating system is Solaris 2.6, you should insert:

	typedef unsigned long uint32_t;

  before the line:

	#include <sys/procfs.h>

  in src/gc/os_dep.c.

- If the platform is Win32, Visual C++'s BIN directory has to be
  in the search path.

- If you have a trouble of the garbage collector, try the latest version
  available from http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc.
  Otherwise, the following step-by-step instruction may help you build
  gc.a.

  Step1: cd src/gc
  Step2: Change os_dep.c and Makefile if necessary
  Step3: make test
	 You should see SUCCEEDED.
  Step4: make clean c++
	 You should see "The test appears to have succeeded."
  Step5: cd ../{Unix,Win32}
  Step6: make
  Step7: cd ../gc; make clean
	 You don't need gc.a any more.

  Note: if your platform is Irix, you have to specify ABI_FLAG (= n32).
