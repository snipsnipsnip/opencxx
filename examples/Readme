OpenC++ Sample Programs
=======================

* verbose

  An object that prints a message when a member function is called for
  the object.

* verbose2

  Verbose object with syntax extension
  Syntax sugar for easily defining verbose objects.

* matrix

  Efficient Matrix Library

  A more efficient matrix class than the ordinary matrix class
  written in regular C++.  This example also shows how to translate
  extended syntax.

* before
  CLOS-like before method.

* wrapper

  A metaclass library for developing your own C++ preprocessor that
  automatically generates wrapper functions.  

* runtime-mop

  A metaclass library for developing your own runtime MOP.  It provides
  almost equivalent functionality of OpenC++ version 1.

* graph

  This produces a Tcl/tk script (gclass-test.wish) for drawing
  the class graph of gclass-test.cc.  The placement of class boxen
  in the window is not cared about very much but you can drag the
  box with the left mouse button.  Since the default metaclass is
  changed, all the classes in gclass-test.cc are parsed and included
  by the class graph.  This sample program was contributed by
  Renaud Pawlak (pawlak@ecoledoc.lip6.fr).
