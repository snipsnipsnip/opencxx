How to add a new test to testsuite/exec
---------------------------------------

(1) Choose short name for test (TNAME), 
    (e.g. `before' was used for test made up of one of the samples)
    make sure it does not clash with any other test in test suite

(2) Prepare the source file `TNAME-class.mc' with metacompiler description.

(3) Prepare the file `TNAME-test.cc' with the source you want to feed
    to the generated compiler

(4) Prepare the text file `TNAME-test.gold' with expected output
    of the executable generated from `TNAME-test.cc' with compiler
    obtained from `TNAME-class.mc'. NOTE: Only stdout output is taken 
    into consideration.

(5) Add the 3 files to EXTRA_DIST in `../Makefile.am'

(6) Change to the top dir and run `./bootstrap' to rebuild `Makefile.in'
