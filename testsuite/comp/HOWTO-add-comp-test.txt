How to add a new test to testsuite/comp
---------------------------------------

(1) Choose short name for test (TNAME), 
    (e.g. `tstart' was used for test checking for a bug that causes the
    compiler to behave differently for class whose name starts with `T')
    make sure it does not clash with any test name in testsuite.

(2) Prepare the source file `TNAME-class.mc' with metacompiler description.

(3) Prepare the file `TNAME-test.cc' with the source you want to feed
    to the generated compiler

(4) Prepare the text file `TNAME-class.gold' with expeced output
    of the compiler generated from `TNAME-class.mc' when translating
    `TNAME-test.cc'. NOTE: Only stdout output is taken into consideration.

(5) Add the 3 files to EXTRA_DIST in `../Makefile.am'

(6) Change to the top dir and run `./bootstrap' to rebuild `Makefile.in'
